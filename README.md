# Heart-Strokes_Predictions
It is a real time project which predicts the patients heart storkes based on machine learning algorithms.
I have used Decision Tree and Random forest to check which suits best in predicting.
I got 90 and 94% accuracy respectively for predictions
It is also visualized in lot of aspects to best outcomes and well trained model.
