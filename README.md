*It is a real time project which predicts the patients heart storkes based on machine learning algorithms.

*I have used Decision Tree and Random forest to check which suits best in predicting.

*Got 90 and 94% accuracy respectively for predictions by classifying patients dataset.

*It is also visualized in lot of aspects to best outcomes and well trained model.
